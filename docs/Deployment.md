# Deploying HEX Migration Toolkit
This project depends on several Microsoft Azure Services both for performance and security purposes. 
Each of these services enable the tool to securely start mailbox migration from on permise Exchange 
environments to Office 365. The following is a list of all the services used to power this solution

* Application Insights
* App Services
* Key Vault
* Service Bus
* Storage

The remaining sections of this guide will walk you through deploying the toolkit.

## Prerequisites 
The following are _required_ prerequisites in order to perform the steps outlined in this guide. 

| Prerequisite                            | Purpose                                                                                 |
|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  Azure AD global admin privileges       | Required to create the required Azure AD application utilized to obtain access tokens.  |
|  Partner Center admin agent privileges  | Required to perform various Partner Center operations through the Partner Center API.   |

If you do not have the privileges then you will not able to perform the remaining operations in this guide.

## Partner Center Azure AD Application
The Partner Center API is utilized to verify the authenticated user belongs to a customer that 
has a relationship with the configured partner. Perform the following to create the application 

1. Login into the [Partner Center](https://partnercenter.microsoft.com) portal using credentials that have _AdminAgents_ and _Global Admin_ privileges
2. Click _Dashboard_ -> _Account Settings_ -> _App Management_ 
3. Click on _Register existing_ app if you want to use an existing Azure AD application, or click _Add new web app_ to create a new one

4. Document the _App ID_ and _Account ID_ values. Also, if necessary create a key and document that value.

## Azure AD Application
Azure AD and Microsoft Graph are utilized to provide authenticationa and authorization for the project. 
Perform the following tasks to create the required Azure AD application 

1. Login into the [Azure Management Portal](https://portal.azure.com) using credentials associated with your Cloud Solution Provider reseller, or integration sandbox, tenant. 
2. Open the _Azure Active Directory_ user experince and then click _App registration_

3. Click _+ Add_ to start the new application wizard
4. Specify an appropriate name for the application, select _Web app / API_ for the application, specify an appropriate value for the sign-on URL, and then click _Create_
5. Click _Required permissions_ button found on the _settings_ blade for the the application and then click _+ Add_
6. Add the following permissions to the _Windows Azure Active Directory_ API the _Sign in and read user profile_ and _Access the directory as the signed-in user_ delegated permissions
7. Add the Microsoft Graph_ API and  grant it the _Read directory data_ application permission
8. Click _Grant Permissions_ button, found on the _Required Permissions_ blade, to consent to the application for the partner tenant 
9. Click the _Keys_ button found on the _settings_ blade and create a key. Be sure to document this value because you will not be able to retreive the value again after you leave the blade.
10. Configure the application for pre-consent using the steps documented [here](Preconsent.md).

## Azure Key Vault 
Azure Key Vault is used to protect application secrets, connection strings, and passwords. To access the instance of Key Vault 
the toolkit will utilize an Azure AD token for an application that is authorized to access the instance. Perform the following to create 
the application and obtain the necessary object identifier.

1. Login into the [Azure Management Portal](https://portal.azure.com) using credentials associated with your Cloud Solution Provider reseller, or integration sandbox, tenant. 
2. Open the _Azure Active Directory_ user experince and then click _App registration_
3. Click _+ Add_ to start the new application wizard
4. Specify an appropriate name for the application, select _Web app / API_ for the application, specify an appropriate value for the sign-on URL, and then click _Create_
5. Click the _Keys_ button found on the _settings_ blade and create a key. Be sure to document this value because you will not be able to retreive the value again after you leave the blade.
6. Within an elevated instance of PowerShell install the Azure AD module

    ```powershell
    Install-Module AzureAD
    ```

7. Modify the following PowerShell cmdlets accordingly to obtain the object identifier for the service principal name assoicated with the application

    ```powershell
    Connect-AzureAD 

    Get-AzureADServicePrincipal | Where-Object {$_.DisplayName -eq 'NAME-OF-THE-APPLICATION-CREATED-ABOVE'}
    ```

8. Document the *ObjectId* value it will be used to deploy the template. 

## Deploy the ARM Template 
An Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template has been developed to simplify the deployment of the solution. When you click the 
*Deploy to Azure* below it will take you to a website where you can populate the parameters for the template.
